 Spotify -Web Player: Music For Everyone Clone
 This project is a Spotify clone built with HTML and CSS. It replicates the user interface of the popular Spotify music streaming platform, focusing on layout and design rather than functionality.
 Sidebar Navigation: The sidebar contains Home, Search, and Your Library sections
 Content sections that display playlists, trending tracks, and featured charts in visually appealing card formats.
 A sticky navigation bar at the top for easy access to options like Explore Premium and Install App.
 A fixed music player at the bottom of the page with play, pause, and navigation controls (purely for display purposes, without backend functionality).
